anomaly_fail.1.desc:0 "No matter which channel you try to tune to, the broadcast just doesn't come through clearly enough to be heard."

ikame_events.1.name:0 "Interstellar Press - Pilot"
ikame_events.1.desc:0 "Word is going round of a new news broadcast channel going live today - will it cover the same doom and gloom as the others, or take an edgier popular-culture route? \n\n Their pilot episode is set to cover the recent trend in mind-controlled board games, and a feature on superstructures and their potential."
ikame_events.1.a:0 "We don't need more wild opinions around here!"
ikame_events.1.b:0 "Interesting, let's see how it goes."

ikame_events.2.name:0 "Interstellar Press - Episode 1"
ikame_events.2.desc:0 "Time for another installment from the IP News Team - reporting live from a silent auction for strange artifacts that have no known purpose or use. Hundreds of potential buyers are present, quarrelling and fawning over a set of seemingly innocuous crystalline rocks. \n\n The bids go from millions to billions in just a few minutes."
ikame_events.2.a:0 "More money than sense. Turn it off!"
ikame_events.2.b:0 "So people will buy any old space junk? Hmm..."

ikame_events.3.name:0 "Interstellar Press - Episode 2"
ikame_events.3.desc:0 "Today the news is all about the lavish parties thrown by an otherwise hyper-zealous empire, following the recent coronation of a new ruler.\n\n Considering the other contenders to the throne died in the literal 'Battle Royale' mandated by the Empire's succession laws, the parties are surprisingly jovial."
ikame_events.3.a:0 "I don't want to hear any more of this rubbish."
ikame_events.3.b:0 "You learn something new every day!"

ikame_events.4.name:0 "Interstellar Press - Episode 3"
ikame_events.4.desc:0 "The scientists of the nation are glued to their visual receivers for today's IP News episode. Full of long science-y words from people with even longer science-y job titles, it seems to be concerning breakthroughs in exoplanet detection methods and classifications. \n\n Whatever that means."
ikame_events.4.a:0 "Information overload. Enough."
ikame_events.4.b:0 "Intriguing! I think..."
