ikame_events.1.name:0 "Interstellar Press - Pilot"
ikame_events.1.desc:0 "Word is going round of a new news broadcast channel going live today - will it cover the same doom and gloom as the others, or take an edgier popular-culture route? \n\n Their pilot episode is set to cover the recent trend in mind-controlled board games, and a feature on superstructures and their potential."

Hundreds of potential buyers are present, quarrelling and fawning over a set of seemingly innocuous crystalline rocks. \n\n The bids go from millions to billions in just a few minutes."
ikame_events.2.a:0 "More money than sense. Turn it off!"
ikame_events.2.b:0 "Maybe we shouldn't throw away all the junk we find out there..."
